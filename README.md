# Thesis
Dowload and Install TexLive: http://mirror.koddos.net/CTAN/systems/texlive/Images/texlive2019.iso </br>
Dowload and Install TexStudio in Windows: https://github.com/texstudio-org/texstudio/releases/download/2.12.22/texstudio-2.12.22-win-qt5.exe </br>
// The download link may vary depending on the current version. </br>
Extract the thesis zip. This should create the Thesis directory. </br>
Step into the Thesis directory and open _thesis.tex with TexStudio. </br>
Compile it; it would generate and open the _thesis.pdf aside. </br>
Whenever you want to modify a sentence or add a remark somewhere, just double click on the area and it shoul bring you in the corresonding tex file. </br>
After completing your suggestion (in tex files), just zip again the thesis folder and send it back to me.
I will see the modification history by using git command, because this is a git project.
